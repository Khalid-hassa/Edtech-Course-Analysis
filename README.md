# Edtech-Course-Analysis

I came up with this project to analyze the dataset to help an Edtech startup to grow their online courses by targeting their best consumer. The main task is to clean and analyse to uncover valuable insights. To ensure the startup can effecitively leverage this information, need to create a dashboard that presents following insights. This analysis will help the company to identify areas for improvement and opportunities for growth in their recorded lecture services.
