# Edtech-Course-Analysis

I came up with this project to analyze the dataset to help an Edtech startup to grow their online courses by targeting their best consumer. The main task is to clean and analyse to uncover valuable insights. To ensure the startup can effecitively leverage this information, need to create a dashboard that presents following insights. This analysis will help the company to identify areas for improvement and opportunities for growth in their recorded lecture services.

1. Examine the distribution of course types across categories to uncover trends and insights, enabling the client to strategically determine which course types to launch in specific categories for maximum impact and alignment with learner demand, also count the number of courses by category and sub-category.


2. Calculate the average number of views for each category, sub-category, and language to provide insights into viewer engagement patterns and inform strategic content development.


3. Identify the most commonly taught skills in today's educational landscape based on the data given based on category to ensure course offerings remain relevant and aligned with current job market demands.


4. What is the distribution of various Languages  in which a particular course is  created?


5. Determine the language preferences for each category based on viewer preferences, so that clients can optimise course accessibility and better align content with audience demand. Clients only want to analyse this data for the top 5 categories based on user preferences.


6. Investigate the relationship between the availability of subtitles and the number of views for courses to determine how subtitle options may impact viewer engagement and accessibility.
